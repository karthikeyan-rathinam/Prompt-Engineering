## **Introduction:**
Brief overview of what an OpenAI Prompt Engineer does. how to write a prompt's for openai and Explanation of why this role is increasingly important in the field of AI.

## **Chapter 1: Understanding OpenAI and Prompt Engineering**

Introduction to OpenAI as a leading research organization in artificial intelligence industry.
Explanation of what prompt engineering is instruction of ai model.

## **Chapter 2: Prerequisites and Skills**

Discussion of the foundational skills required for prompt engineering, including:
- Proficiency in programming languages such as **Python**.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Understanding of natural language processing (NLP) fundamentals.
- Highlighting the importance of critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

## **Chapter 3: Educational Pathways**
Overview of educational backgrounds commonly pursued by individuals entering prompt engineering roles, such as:
- Degrees in computer science, artificial intelligence, or related fields.
- Online courses and resources for learning machine learning and NLP.
- Specialized bootcamps or workshops focused on AI and deep learning.

## **Chapter 4: Lets start setup**
Setup Load the OpenAI API Key and libaries. 
- setup following way environment variable: (.env file)
```env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk.....
```
- Load OpenAI API key in your workspace.
```python
  import openai
  import os
  
  from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
  _ =  load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
  openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```
- If you using OpenAI < 1.0.0 version 
```python
def chat_completion(prompt,model='gpt-3.5-turbo'):
  messages = [{"role":"user","content":prompt}]
  responce = openai.ChatCompetion.create(
    model=model,
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0 # The degree of randomness of the model outpu
  ) 
  return responce.choices[0].message['content'] # only return output string
```

- Check other openai model : [Check List](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview)

- If you using OpenAI > 1.0.0 version 
```python
def chat_completion(prompt,model='gpt-3.5-turbo'):
  messages = [{"role":"user","content":prompt}]
  responce = client.chat.competions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0 # The degree of randomness of the model outpu
  ) 
  return responce.choices[0].message['content'] # only return output string
```

## **Chapter 5: Prompting Principles**
Openai prompting principles there are 2 types are:
- Principle 1 : Write a clear and specific instructions
- Principle 2 : Give the model time to 'think'


## **Chapter 6: Gaining Experience**

Strategies for gaining practical experience in prompt engineering, including:
- Contributing to open-source projects related to NLP and machine learning.
- Participating in AI hackathons or competitions.
- Seeking internships or research assistant positions at organizations working on AI projects.
